# Jotai Provider Playground

The Jotai documentation didn't quite give a comprehensive explanation of how the Provider component works, so I made
this app to play around and experiment.

I've added some basic use examples to start, but I want to try out other more complicated setups. For example: Scoped
atom usage outside of a scoped provider, unscoped atom usage inside of a scoped provider, layered providers, etc.

`npm install` -> `npm start` to play around.
