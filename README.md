# Jotai Provider Playground

The Jotai documentation didn't quite give a comprehensive explanation of how the Provider component works, so I made this
app to play around and see how everything works.

I've added some basic examples of usage, but I'm planning to try out other combinations and see what happens. For
example: Scoped atom usage outside of a scoped provider, unscoped atom usage inside of a scoped provider, layered
providers, etc.


`npm install` -> `npm start` to play around.
